![](https://github.com/Lackshan/blog/workflows/Build%20and%20deploy%20Jekyll%20site%20to%20GitHub%20Pages/badge.svg)

This blog showcases my various projects.

## Prerequisites
First follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll.

## Build
### Serve site locally for testing
To host the site locally run:
```bash
cd jekyll_site
JEKYLL_ENV="production" bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Generate static files for hosting
```bash
cd jekyll_site
JEKYLL_ENV="production" bundle exec jekyll build
```
## Deploy
### Automated deployment using GitHub Actions
After every commit, the action defined in ```.github/workflows/github-pages.yml``` will build the site and copy the contents of the resulting ```_site``` folder to the ```gh-pages``` branch.
