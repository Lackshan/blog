# Project Blog
This blog showcases my various projects.

## Prerequisites
First follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll.

# Serving site locally for testing
To host the site locally run:
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV="production" bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# Generating static files for hosting
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV="production" bundle exec jekyll build
```

It uses the sudo theme which can be found [here](https://github.com/oneohthree/sudo-jekyll).
